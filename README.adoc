= Native sample with Spring Boot 3

This sample can be used to hack on Native with Spring Boot 3.

NOTE: This is a work in progress and requires a local build of Spring Boot.

== Setup

You need to install a version of Spring Boot `3.0.0-SNAPSHOT` from the `aot` branch

[indent=0]
----
	$ git checkout aot
	$ ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

You also need to have a `native-image` in your path. The easiest way to get started
is with SDKMan:

[indent=0]
----
	$ sdk install java 22.0.0.2.r17-nik
----

Once GraalVM is installed, you need to use it in your shell:

[indent=0]
----
	$ sdk use java 22.0.0.2.r17-nik
----

Validate that GraalVM is available in your shell:

[indent=0]
----
	$ java -version
	openjdk version "17.0.2" 2022-01-18 LTS
	OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM 22.0.0.2 (build 17.0.2+9-LTS)
	OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM 22.0.0.2 (build 17.0.2+9-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
----

== Building

To build the project and generate a native image for it, run the following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw package -Pnative
----

== Running

One the build has completed, the native executable is in your `target` directory. You
can run it as follows:

[indent=0]
----
	$ target/demo-native-sample
----
